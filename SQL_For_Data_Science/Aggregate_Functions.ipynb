    "#### **Simple functions**\n",
    "A ***simple function*** operates on an expression enclosed in parentheses, called an ***argument***, and returns a value. The expression is usually a column name or fixed value, but may include operators and other functions. Some functions have several arguments, separated by commas, and a few have no arguments.\n",

    "Each simple function operates on, and evaluates to, specific data types. Ex: The LOG function operates on any numeric data type and returns a DOUBLE value. If the argument is invalid, the function returns NULL. Ex: The SQRT function computes the square root of positive numbers only, so SQRT(-1) returns NULL.\n",

    "An ***aggregate function*** processes values from a set of rows and returns a summary value. Aggregate functions appear in a SELECT clause and process all rows that satisfy the WHERE clause condition. If a SELECT statement has no WHERE clause, the aggregate function processes all rows.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "- **COUNT()** counts the number of selected values.\n",
    "- **MIN()** finds the minimum of selected values.\n",
    "- **MAX()** finds the maximum of selected values.\n",
    "- **SUM()** sums selected values.\n",
    "- **AVG()** computes the arithmetic mean of selected values.\n",
    "- **VARIANCE()** computes the standard variance of selected values.\n",
    "\n",
    "Aggregate functions have a single argument. The argument may be any expression but is usually a column name. Aggregate functions ignore rows for which the expression evaluates to NULL.\n",

    "\n",
    "    SELECT COUNT(*) \n",
    "    FROM Employee \n",
