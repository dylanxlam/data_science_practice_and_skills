    "A ***join*** is a SELECT statement that combines data from two tables, known as the ***left table*** and ***right table***, into a single result. The tables are combined by comparing columns from the left and right tables, usually with the = operator. The columns must have comparable data types.\n",

    "#### **Prefixes and aliases**\n",
    "Occasionally, join tables contain columns with the same name. When duplicate column names appear in a query, the names must be distinguished with a prefix. The prefix is the table name followed by a period.\n",
