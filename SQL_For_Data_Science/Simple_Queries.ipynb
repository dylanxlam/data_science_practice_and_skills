    "**SQLite** is a lightweight, file-based relational database management system (RDBMS) that is widely used for embedded database applications, testing, prototyping, and small-scale web applications. Unlike client-server databases like MySQL, PostgreSQL, or Oracle, SQLite does not require a separate server process to be running. Instead, it directly accesses and manipulates the database stored in a single disk file.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some key features of SQLite:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Serverless**: SQLite is serverless, meaning there is no need to set up a separate database server process. The database engine is embedded within the application, and database operations are performed directly on the database file.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Self-contained**: SQLite databases are self-contained, stored as a single disk file. This makes SQLite databases easy to distribute and manage.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Zero Configuration**: SQLite databases require minimal setup and configuration. You don't need to install or configure a database server or manage user permissions.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Transactional**: SQLite supports ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) transactions, ensuring data integrity and reliability.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Cross-platform**: SQLite is cross-platform and runs on various operating systems, including Windows, macOS, Linux, and Unix-like systems."
