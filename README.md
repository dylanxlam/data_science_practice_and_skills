# Data Science Practice and Skills

In this repository, we will learn machine learning algorithms to find patterns in large datasets.
We will cover classification, clustering, anomaly detection, and association analysis. We will
use Python’s scikit-learn packages, and Jupyter Notebooks, two industry-standard tools for data
mining. Data mining has already changed the way in which many important decisions are made.
In today’s data-driven world, it is increasingly critical to understand how these algorithms come
to their conclusions and the correct ways to interpret and apply their results.
