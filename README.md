# Data Science Practice and Skills

In this repository, we will learn machine learning algorithms to find patterns in large datasets.
We will cover classification, clustering, anomaly detection, and association analysis. We will
use Python’s scikit-learn packages, and Jupyter Notebooks, two industry-standard tools for data
mining. Data mining has already changed the way in which many important decisions are made.
In today’s data-driven world, it is increasingly critical to understand how these algorithms come
to their conclusions and the correct ways to interpret and apply their results.

What will we get out of this practice?
• Appreciate the Data Science and the scope of its potential applications.
• Be able to summarize and present data in meaningful ways.
• Understand basic machine learning algorithms.
• Select the appropriate data analysis and machine learning algorithm depending on the
research question.
• Understand and verify the underlying assumptions of a particular machine learning algo-
rithm.
• Effectively and clearly communicate results from analyses performed to others.
• Conduct, present, and interpret common data analytics using Python packages.
